# Hi, I'm HALIE! :mermaid: :herb: :sparkles:

HALIE, otherwise known as Hybrid-Approach Language Interpretation Experiment, is a conversational chatbot written in Python. 

## Motivation

I have always been fascinated by language and the way humans use it. As implied by the name, HALIE was created as an experiment - specifically, an experiment to create a bot that thinks about language in a way that mimics the way humans think about it.  

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Natural Language Toolkit
